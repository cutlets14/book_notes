# Digital Minimalism
## Cal Newport - Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World

General notes:
1. Our brains are highly susceptible to intermittent positive reinforcement and the drive for social approval. This matters because many of the apps and sites that keep people compulsively checking their smartphones and opening browser tabs often leverage these hooks to make themselves nearly impossible to resist.

***Digital Minimalism*** 📱 🛑 = 🧠 ☮️ <br> 
A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else. Why digital minimalism works rests on three principles:

***Principle #1*** - Clutter is costly.
> Having too many apps, devices, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation.

***Principle #2*** - Optimization is important.
> Deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it's necessary to think carefully about how they'll use the technology.

***Principle #3*** - Intentionality is satisfying.
> Being more intentional about how to engage with new technologies is a significant source of satisfaction to digital minimalists. This source is independent of the specific decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons minimalism tends to be immensely meaningful to its practitioners.

The Digital Declutter Process 
1. Put aside a thirty-day period where I will take a break from all optional technologies in my life.
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item
    <ol>
      <li>Indented item</li>
      <li>Indented item</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ol>
3. During this break, explore and re-discover activities that I find meaningful and satisfying.
4. At the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies into my life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology I introduce, determine what value it serves in my life and how specifically I will use it so as to maximize this value.
